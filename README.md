# PetriRL: Advanced Scheduling with Petri Nets and Reinforcement Learning

**PetriRL** combines the formalism of Petri Nets with reinforcement learning to tackle dynamic scheduling in Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS). It offers a reproducible framework for research and industrial applications, demonstrating improved makespan and computational efficiency using **Colored-Timed Petri Nets (CTPNs)** and **actor-critic reinforcement learning**. 

## PetriRL Intralogistics

`PetriRL_intralogistics` is one of the environments provided in the PetriRL package. It focuses on **Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS)** and is designed to handle complex intralogistics challenges, including **AGV scheduling**, **tool-sharing optimization**, and dynamic job shop scheduling.  

Our approach combines the structural modeling power of Petri nets with the dynamic decision-making of policy-based reinforcement learning. Key aspects include:

- **Dynamic Action Masking:** Token distributions in the Petri net generate dynamic masks that reduce the RL search space, improve sample efficiency, aid credit assignment, and mitigate the combinatorial curse.
- **Policy-Based Reinforcement Learning:** Enhances knowledge retention and transferability, allowing the agent to generalize to unseen problems and make near real-time decisions.
- **Explainability:** Graphical semantics and token flows provide insights into scheduling decisions.
- **Scalability:** Modular Petri net design supports large, complex systems.
- **Model-Based RL Rollouts:** Used to determine optimal AGV positioning, further improving operational efficiency.

This environment (`petrirl-fms-v0`) provides a realistic testbed for dynamic scheduling and resource management in modern manufacturing systems.

## Why PetriRL?

Flexible Manufacturing Systems require adaptive and efficient resource management. PetriRL enhances traditional job shop scheduling by:

- **Integrating AGVs and Tool-Sharing Systems:** Optimizes multiple components simultaneously.
- **Dynamic Action Masking:** Reduces the action space for faster decision-making.
- **Learning-Based Adaptability:** Actor-critic RL adapts to dynamic environments and unexpected events.
